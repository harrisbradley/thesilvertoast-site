# The Silver Toast 🥂

**The Silver Toast** is a simple, global celebration.

When silver reaches $100, people around the world will join a short live stream, raise a celebratory drink, and mark the moment together.

No selling.  
No speeches.  
Just a toast.

## What This Is

The Silver Toast exists to commemorate a single, shared moment in time.

It is:
- A global live toast
- A recognition of patience and conviction
- A pause to acknowledge a milestone many have followed for years

Participation requires only presence and a raised glass.

It is intentionally non-commercial and independent.

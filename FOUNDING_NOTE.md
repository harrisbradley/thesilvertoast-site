# Founding Note

This project began with a simple observation:

Some milestones are discussed for years, yet pass with barely a pause when they finally arrive.

Silver has been one of those stories — debated, dismissed, and revisited across decades. For many, the number itself became less important than the patience required to wait for it.

The Silver Toast exists to mark that patience.

It is not meant to persuade anyone of anything.  
It is not a victory lap.  
It is not an argument.

It is a moment of recognition.

When silver reaches $100, the intention is not to rush forward, but to stop — briefly — and acknowledge that time, conviction, and uncertainty all played their part.

No one owns that moment.  
No institution defines it.  
No individual speaks for it.

A glass raised in one place looks the same as a glass raised anywhere else.

This project was created to make that shared pause possible, and then to step out of the way.

Nothing more is required.
